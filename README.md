This mod intends to change the reforging system for both accessories and weapons so that all reforges are viable, enabling more variety in gameplay. All of the vanilla reforges have been either reworked or removed for cohesiveness.

ACCESSORIES
-Defensive prefixes are the same.

-Arcane's effect has been doubled. It probably still needs a change, but we will see.

-Precise and Lucky's effects have been doubled.

-Melee swing speed has been changed to global weapon speed (so now that everything benefits from it) and the effect is doubled.

-Damage prefixes' effects have been increased by 50%.

-Weapon Speed, Movement Speed, and Damage prefixes now apply multiplicatively to all other buffs and do not 'compete' with armor / accessory buffs. This means that if you do 100 damage with no 
accessory prefixes (but armor buffs and etc. active), having +40% damage in accessory prefixes leads to 140 damage regardless of your armor or other buffs instead of stacking additively with the other buffs.

-Movement speed buffs now apply to the vertical and horizontal movement of wings and max speed with Hermes Boots.

-In general, weapon reforges do more interesting things and there is no universal best modifier. Still, all reforges are now about the level of a vanilla tier 2 prefix (Godly, Deadly, Legendary, etc.)

-Ranged weapons can now have an Accuracy modifier, which multiplicatively changes the angular spread of a weapon.

-Summoning weapons now have their exclusive pool so that they will not pull reforges that give speed, mana cost, or crit chance because these don't do anything. With so little variation, only 4 summon reforges currently exist...

-I plan to give Summoning staffs a Minion Spawn Cost modifier, but as of yet that has not been implemented as it is difficult and I do not know how to do it.

This mod may not be compatible with other mods, especially mods that do anything with reforges. However, I do recognize that this mod may be poorly coded and therefore some incompatibilites can be avoided: so if this relevant, I would still like to know about it.
